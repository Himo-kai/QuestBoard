# üß≠ QuestBoard

**QuestBoard** is a gamified terminal-based job board that aggregates and curates gig listings‚Äîturning freelance hunting into an RPG-inspired experience. It pulls quests from **Craigslist** (Las Vegas), **Reddit** (`r/donedirtcheap`), and **user submissions** based on smart keyword matching, skill tagging, and difficulty estimation.

Smart Matching Logic

Feature	Description

Gear Suggestions	Pulls gear names from a curated keyword list (editable via gear_keywords.py)

AI Matching	Uses sentence-transformers to detect jobs relevant to "AI", "tech", etc., even if not explicitly stated

Filtering	Automatically excludes irrelevant gigs (e.g., "study", "girls", "women") unless tagged tech-relevant
Compensation	Rewards are parsed from listing content; posts with "TBD" or "$0" are excluded unless high-priority
